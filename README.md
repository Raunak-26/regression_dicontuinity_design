# Abstract

Controlling for higher degrees of polynomials for the forcing variable is a common 
practice in regression discontinuity analysis. Such models can overfit, resulting 
in substantively implausible causal inferences that randomly contribute variation 
to the high-degree polynomial and can lead to false estimates. The aim of this 
paper is to investigate the three arguments presented in Gelman and Imbens (2019). 

The arguments recommends against the use of high-order polynomial approximations 
are: 

* the implicit weights are inappropriate
* the estimates are sensitive to the degree of polynomial, and
* poor coverage of confidence intervals. 

Instead of using global high-order polynomial, the paper suggests using local 
linear or quadratic polynomial approximations.

# Introduction

Regression discontinuity designs have significantly gained importance in econometric 
and causal inference over the past few decades. Introduced in 1960 by Donald L.
Thistlethwaite and Donald T. Campbell, the regression discontinuity design aims to 
estimate the impact of a treatment policy on the variable of interest. The simplicity
of the design enables its application across research fields, like health, labor, 
education, political economy, etc.
    
The basic idea behind the regression discontinuity (RD) design is that the allotment 
of the treatment is based on the value of the predictor (also known as assignment/
forcing variable) being on either side of a fixed threshold. Further, the assignment
variable may be related to the potential outcome, however, this relation is assumed 
to be smooth which implies that any discontinuity at the cutoff point in the 
conditional expectation of the outcome as a function of the assignment variable is 
because of the treatment and this discontinuity gap represents the causal effect of 
the treatment. For instance, Thistlethwaite and Campbell studied the role of merit 
awards on future academic outcomes by allocating awards only to the students who had 
scored above a threshold score value in a test, while the students who scored below 
the cutoff point did not receive any award.
    
In regression discontintuity, the average treatment effect can be estimated as the 
discontinuity in the conditional expectation of the outcome given the assignment 
variable at the threshold. The equaiton then can be represented as:

$$ \tau_{SRD} = \lim_{x\downarrow c} \mathbb{E}[Y_{i} | X_{i}=x] - \lim_{x\uparrow c} \mathbb{E}\left[Y_{i} | X_{i}=x\right]$$

which can be simply written as:

$$ \tau_{SRD} = \mathbb{E}\left[Y_{i}(1) - Y_{i}(0)| X = c\right]$$

Here, $\tau_{SRD}$ is the 'Average Treatment Effect' at threshold $c$.

This can also be seen in figure below, which illustrates a sharp RD design with the threshold 
at 6. Individuals right to the threshold are given the treatment, while those to the left 
are the control group. The dashed line represents the value of the potential outcome for the 
treated group and control group if they were observable beyond their treatment status. The 
smooth lines indicate the observed outcome conditional on the assignment variable. Under the 
continuity assumption, therefore, the average treatment effect, Ï„SRD is given by the jump in 
outcome value at threshold 6.

</p> 

In the above equation the problem is the estimate the values of $\mu_+$ and $\mu_-$

$$\qquad \mu_{+} = \lim_{x\downarrow c} \mathbb{E}\left[Y_{i} | X_{i}=x\right] \\qquad \text{and}, \mu_{-} = \lim_{x\uparrow c} \mathbb{E}\left[Y_{i} | X_{i}=x\right]$$

Since researchers are often unsure about the efficiency of the estimates based on global linear function, 
they often use polynomial functions of order fifth or sixth of the assignment variable, $X$ in the regression 
model. The appropriate degree of polynomial is mainly selected based on some statistical information 
criteria (like goodness-of-fit) or cross-validation.
    
The other approach to estimate $\mu_{+}$ and $\mu_{-}$ and consequently the treatment effect is to use local 
low-order (linear or quadratic) polynomial approximation. In this method, the values of $x_{i}$ around the 
threshold $c$ that lie within the bandwidth $h$ are used to estimate a linear or quadratic function, while 
the rest of the values of $x_{i}$ are discarded. Several methods have been developed to estimate the value 
of $g$ (see Imbens and Kalyanaraman(2012), Hahn, Todd, and Van Der Klaauw (2001), Lee and Lemieux(2010)).

Gelman and Imbens(2019)\cite{gelman2019high} believe that the former approach, that is, to use the global 
high-order polynomials to estimate the causal treatment effect is flawed and rather the inference should 
be based on local low-order polynomials. The authors bring forth threefold arguments to show global 
high-order polynomials as a poor model choice for regression discontinuity analysis.

* The first argument is that the estimates of the treatment effect can be driven by the values of 
the forcing variable that are away from the threshold. Since the RD estimate is the difference between 
the weighted average of the outcome for the treated and untreated, wherein the weights depend only on 
the forcing variable; the weights in a global high-order polynomial approximation are extreme and 
unattractive compared to a local linear/quadratic approximation.

* The second argument put forward is that the estimates in the case of global high-order polynomials 
are highly sensitive to the chosen degree of the polynomial of the forcing variable $X$. Further, a lack 
of just criteria to select the order of polynomials that is suitable for the estimator to satisfy its 
objectives of causal inference exacerbates the issue.

* Finally, the third argument is that the confidence interval based on the estimates of global 
high-order polynomials is often misleading. The confidence intervals can be too narrow that they reject 
the null hypothesis even when it shouldn't have, that is, the probability of Type 1 error rate is much 
higher than the nominal rate of 5\%. This implies that there is a higher bias in the case of global 
high-order polynomials to detect a discontinuity even if there isn't one, and hence, generate poor inference.

The target of our paper is to test the veracity of these arguments through a simulation study and 
empirical application (wherever possible). The paper hereby proceeds as follows. In the next section, 
we introduce the model specification of the RD design that is used to critique the aforementioned arguments. 
Thereafter, we evaluate our results based on the simulation and empirical evidence so as to comment on 
the feasibility of global high-order polynomials in RD design.

# Methodology

In practice, it is convenient to run a pooled regression to obtain the average treatment effect of the SRD 
rather than to estimate the values of $\mu_{+}$ and $\mu_{-}$ and then take their difference. This general 
 approach of pooled regression based on Lee and Lemieux (2010) can be represented as:This general approach 
 of pooled regression based on Lee and Lemieux (2010) can be represented as:

$$\qquad Y = \beta_{1} + \tau_{SRD} D + f(X-c) + \epsilon$$

Where, $\beta_{1}$ is the intercept term and equal to $\beta_{1}^{+} - \beta_{1}^{-}$\
$\tau_{SRD}$ represents the estimate of the treatment effect.\
$D$ is the dummy variable that takes value $1$ if $\{X \geq c \}$ and $0$ if $\{X < c \}$.\
$f(X-c)$ represents the functional form of the assignment variable of the regression function and is equivalent to \
$$\qquad f(X-c) = f^{-}(X-c) + D \left[f^{+}(X-c) - f^{-}(X-c) \right].$$

Hence, we can write the regression function in the form of: \
$$\qquad Y = \beta_{1} + \tau_{SRD}D + \beta_{2}(X-c) + \beta_{3}(X-c)^{2} + \beta_{4}D(X-c) + \beta_{5}D(X-c)^2 + \epsilon$$

The equation stated above can therefore be also considered the regression function for the global 
high-order polynomial approach. The local linear/quadratic approach is distinct from the former 
approach in the sense that for a certain bandwidth value $h$ and the consequent range around the 
threshold point $(c-h \leq X \leq c+h)$, the set of values of the forcing variable that lie outside 
of this range are dropped for the estimation of ATE. This implies that the regression function changes to:

$$\qquad Y = \beta_{1} + \tau_{SRD}D + \beta_{2}(X-c) + \beta_{3}(X-c)^{2} + \beta_{4}D(X-c) + \beta_{5}D(X-c)^2 + \epsilon$$\
where, $(c-h)\leq X \leq (c+h)$.

The advantage of such a regression form is that it introduces varying slopes on both sides of the threshold
through the interaction term between $X$ and $D$, which is often the case in empirical applications.

## Data Generating Process for Simulaiton

The objective of the simulation study is to test the arguments presented by Gelman and Imbens (2019)
in favor of the local low-order polynomial approximation for an RD analysis. We conduct the study for 
a Sharp Regression Discontinuity framework.

To conduct a Monte Carlo study, we first develop an SRD model. We consider a model with a constant 
average treatment effect, which means that the only change for the treated group compared to the control 
is of an additive shift  by a value equal to the treatment effect. Further, we consider a functional form 
of up to sixth-order polynomial. The model developed hereby is based on the data generating process in 
Imbens and Kalyanaraman 2012

The data generating process for $Y$, then can be defined as:

$$Y = 0.42 + 0.56D + 0.84X - 3.00X^{2} + 7.99X^{3} - 9.01X^{4} + 3.56X^{5} + 6.11X^{6} + e$$

where, the forcing variable is derived from a beta distribution $Z = B(\alpha = 2, \beta = 5)$. 
The forcing variable is then of the form:

$$X \sim 2^{*}Z - 1 $$

We introduce the threshold point at $c = 0$, which implies that all the individuals above this point 
are given treatment, while those below the cutoff point are not. We consider the true value of the 
estimate of treatment effect as \textbf{0.56}. And the treatment status is introduced in the data 
generating process through the dummy variable, $D$ where:

$$D = \begin{cases}1, & x_{i}\geq 0\\
0, & x_{i} < 0\ \end{cases}$$

And, the random error term follows a normal distribution with mean $0$ and standard deviation $0.1295$, 
that is,
 
$$e \sim \mathbb{N}(\mu = 0, \sigma = 0.1295)$$

Based on the above specification, we simulate a dataset of sample size, $n = 100,000$, which is then 
used to conduct an analysis of our objectives.

# Argument 1: Noisy Weigths

In an RD design, researchers are interested in estimating the impact of treatment at the cutoff point. 
Since the treatment effect estimates can be represented as the difference between the weighted average 
of outcomes for the treated and the control, one should expect an allocation of higher weights to the 
observations closer to the cutoff point. However, Gelman and Imbens (2019) argue that for the global 
polynomial approach, high and erratic weights are allotted to observations that are far from the 
threshold. This implies that the estimates calculated from such a model framework might be biased.

The weights are just a function of the assignment variable $X$. Thus, we can calculate the weights allotted 
to each observation of the forcing variable for different bandwidth values $h$ and the order of 
polynomial $K$ and examine them without even considering the functional form of the data or the outcome 
value. The weights can then be derived in a similar manner as Gelman and Imbens (2019) which is as follows:

$$\qquad w_{i} = 1_{c \leq x_{i} \leq h}.e^\prime_{K+1,1}
\begin{pmatrix}
\sum_{j:c \leq x_j \leq h}
\begin{pmatrix}
1 & x_j & \cdots & x_j^K \\
x_j & x_j^2 & \cdots & x_j^{K+1} \\
\vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
x_j^K & x_j^{K+1} & \cdots & x_j^{2K}
\end{pmatrix}
\end{pmatrix}^{-1} 
\begin{pmatrix}
1 \\  x_i \\ \vdots \\ x_i^K
\end{pmatrix}$$

Where, 
* The values of the forcing variable, $X$, are above the threshold $c$, and within the bandwidth $h$
* $e$ is the K+1 column vector, with the first element equal to 1 and the rest elements equal to $0$
* 1$ denotes the sum vector with its length equal to the number of values of forcing variable between 
  $c$ and $h$.
* $w_{i}$ is the weight allotted to each individual $i$ of the assignment variable $X$ for bandwidth 
  value $h$ and order of polynomial $K$. We can then obtain the weight vector, $w$, with its elements 
  equal to the weight allotted to each individual $i$ of the assignment variable $X$ for bandwidth 
  value $h$ and order of polynomial $K$. The average weight of the vector has been normalized to 1.
  
Given the data generating process and the weights functions defined in the above formula, we calculated
the weigths results for global high-order polynomial and local polynomial. In case of the local linear 
and quadratic regressoin the bandwidth is calculated based on Imbens and Kalyanaraman (2012) optimal 
bandwidth selector. These weight vectors are thereby plotted with the observations of forcing variables 
above the threshold on the X-Axis and the corresponding weights on the Y-Axis which can be shown in the 
figure below.

  <br>
  <em>Weights for Global High-Order Polynomial - Simulation Study</em>
</p> 

As can be seen from figure, the weights associated with global high-order polynomials are indeed high 
and erratic irrespective of the polynomial order. Further, it is also noticeable that higher weights 
are allotted to the observations away from the threshold. We also observe that for large values of the 
forcing variable, the associated weights are quite sensitive to the order of polynomials. Finally, similar
to the global polynomial approach, we plot the derived weight vectors in order to inspect the weights 
assigned to each observation of the forcing variable that lies above the threshold.

</p> 

Further, we perform the above stated steps for empirical application as well. We use the New York: 
MDRC, 2012 dataset for this study. we arrive at similar results as of the simulation study. The detailed
analysis of this empirical application can be found in the <a href= "https://github.com/vanshajbindlish/regression_dicontuinity_design/blob/main/paper/rm_paper.pdf">paper</a>.

# Argument 2: Estimates are Highly Sensitive to the Degree of Polynomial

The second argument in favor of why the researchers should not use high-order global polynomial 
approximations for forcing variables in a regression discontinuity design setting is that the 
estimates obtained from such setting are sensitive to the order of the polynomial in forcing variable.

The data generating process for RD design that is used in this simulation study is defined in 
data generating process simulation study. We first created the original data of a $100,000$ 
sample size. The forcing variable is defined as $X \sim 2^{*}Z - 1$, where $Z$ follows a beta 
distribution $Z = B(\alpha = 2, \beta = 5)$, and the error term is distributed normally 
$e \sim \mathbb{N}(\mu = 0, \sigma = 0.1295)$. In the simulation study, we sample $5,000$ 
observations from the original dataset and repeat this sampling process for $2,000$ iterations 
and store the estimates and standard errors, and then average them over iterations. With this 
setup and $6^{th}$ order of the forcing variable we looped the above simulation with the increasing 
standard deviations of the error term from $0.1$ to $3$ with an increment of $0.2$. This additional
step is to introduce more dynamic errors into a complex model and to check how the results of
estimates and standard errors of the treatment effect perform for global and local polynomials.
The true value of the treatment effect is specified as \textbf{0.56} in simulation study. 
The results for the above simulation are shown in the table below. 

| Order of Polynomial | Estimate (Simulation Study) | (s.e.) (Simulation Study) | Estimate (Empirical Application) | (s.e.) (Empirical Application) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| global 1 | $-3.89$ | $0.20$ | $10.66$ | $0.59$ |
| global 2 | $2.18$ | $0.17$ | $9.14$ | $0.79$ |
| global 3 | $0.26$ | $0.21$ | $9.61$ | $1.01$ |
| global 4 | $0.50$ | $0.25$ | $10.52$ | $1.24$ |
| global 5 | $0.50$ | $0.30$ | $10.75$ | $1.52$ |
| global 6 | $0.53$ | $0.35$ | $11.49$ | $1.85$ |
| local 1 | $0.45$ | $0.175$ | $10.55$ | $1.26$ |
| local 2 | $0.54$ | $0.25$ | $11.19$ | $1.02$ |

We also added the results of the empirical application in the last two columns. You can see
the <a href= "https://github.com/vanshajbindlish/regression_dicontuinity_design/tree/main/paper">paper</a>
for comprehensive interpretation of the results.

# Argument 3: Inferences Do Not Achieve Nominal Coverage

The third argument is that the confidence interval for the estimates of the treatment effects 
can have lower nominal coverage when using global high-order polynomials for the forcing variable. 
On the other hand can provide a better coverage when using local linear or quadratic polynomials. 
For this study, we created a simulation study on an artificially generated dataset as stated in 
data generating process above. Further we did a similar study on a Life Expectancy (WHO) Kaggle 
dataset. The aim of this study is to find how efficiently the confidence interval represents the 
true population parameter. We estimate the treatment effect for the discontinuities in the 
artificial setting, where there are no discontinuities to be found. Thereafter, we calculate 
the rejection rates rates using confidence intervals and true parameter to check the soundness 
of the results. 

For simulation study of this argument, we take into account the data generating process is 
mentioned is mentioned in argument 2 that is defined in Data Generating Process subsection, 
except for the fact that the discontinuity for the conditional expectation of the dependent 
variable as a function of the forcing variable at the threshold is zero. In simpler terms, 
there is no discontinuity in $Y$ as a function of $X$, so $Y$ is a smooth function. Further, 
the standard deviation for the error term is fixed to the value $0.1295$. \\

First, we randomly choose $20,000$ data points from the original dataset that are used as 
pseudo-thresholds as there is no actual discontinuity in the dataset. These data points are 
chosen using a uniform distribution between the $0.25$ and $0.75$ percentiles of the true 
distribution of the forcing variable. Thereafter, we sample a set of $M = 5,000$ individuals 
from the original data set for every single pseudo-threshold. This helps us to create enough 
data points for better results of the simulations study. Given the randomly selected threshold a
nd $5,000$ data points, we calculate the estimated treatment effect and standard errorÂ for 
the pseudo-treatment using global and local approximations. With the $95\%$ confidence interval, 
we check how many times (in percentage) the confidence interval excludes zero. Given no 
discontinuity in the data, we should expect that only $5\%$ of the times the confidence interval 
for the randomly selected threshold does not include zero. 

We did this exercise for the global polynomial up to the sixth order and two local polynomials. 
For each iteration, we use Imbens and Kalyanaraman 2012\cite{imbens2012optimal} optimal bandwidth 
selector to select the bandwidth $h$ for local polynomials and exclude data points with X values 
that are more than $h$ units away from the threshold and focus on the local estimates with the 
data points that are close to the threshold. The standard errors of the treatment effect are median 
of $20,000$ calculated data points for global and local approximations. The results are shown in the 
first two numerical columns of Table \ref{table:arg3}. Given the true regression function is on both 
sides of the threshold is of sixth-order in the forcing variable, we can expect the $95\%$ confidence 
interval should include the true treatment effect, which is $0$, close to $95\%$ of the time and be
approximately unbiased.

Figure below shows the box plot representation of the estimates of the treatment effect for 
the simulation study in argument 3. Here, $Yâˆ’axis$ represents the estimates for the treatment effect, 
and the first six box plots on the $X-axis$ represent the estimates of the treatment effect for six-order 
of global polynomial followed by local linear and quadratic polynomial. The boxplot represents the mean 
and the spread of the $20,000$ estimates in the simulation study. The labels of the $Xâˆ’axis$ show the 
rejection rate for the corresponding degree of the polynomial in the respective order. The dotted line 
parallels the $X-axis$ and corresponds to the true treatment effect, which is zero.

  <em>Box plot showing Simulation Study Estimates</em>
</p> 
    
The $95\%$ confidence interval suggests that, given no discontinuity in the data, the confidence 
interval should capture the true value of the treatment effect (which is zero) $95\%$ of the times. 
However, the underperformance of the global polynomials can be visually seen in the boxplot. While 
their counterparts provide significant coverage, the confidence interval from the estimates of the
first to third-order global polynomials do not capture the true treatment effect significantly.
The mean of estimates of the treatment effect for the second-order polynomial is roughly $0.38$ 
as shown in the orange box plot, which actually lies far off the true treatment effect. The global 
polynomialâ€™s confidence intervals fail to achieve the nominal coverage for the population parameter
significantly. This strengthens the fact that inferences from global polynomials don't achieve 
nominal coverage.

The Table below shows the result of global and local confidence interval rejection rate for both 
simulation study and empirical application. You can see the <a href= "https://github.com/vanshajbindlish/regression_dicontuinity_design/blob/main/paper/rm_paper.pdf">paper</a>

# Conclusion

Regression Discontinuity Designs are one of the standard techniques used in econometrics 
and statistics to obtain causal effects from the observed data. One of the practices in 
implementing regression discontinuity designs is controlling for high-order polynomial 
approximations for the treatment effect of the forcing variable. This paper is a review 
of the paper written by Gelman and Imbens (2019) and strengthens the 
three arguments and recommends not to use high-order polynomials to estimate the treatment 
effects in regression discontinuity designs. The arguments are: the implicit weights 
calculated for high-order polynomial approximations are unattractive, estimates are highly 
sensitive to the order of polynomials, and the confidence intervals have less than nominal 
coverage. The arguments are presented in the context of sharp regression designs, but using 
local linear or quadratic regression over global polynomials is recommended for fuzzy 
regression designs as well.
    
The point of the paper is to explore the three arguments suggested by Gelman and Imbens (2019). 
We conduct simulation studies based on regression discontinuity and empirical applications on 
real data that support the authorsÂ´ arguments against using high-order polynomial approximations
and instead recommends using local linear or quadratic estimates for estimating treatment effect. 
The question that is to be asked is that, why high-order polynomial approximations are popular 
despite having many unattractive properties. The motivation behind using high-order polynomials 
for forcing variables is that they can map a smooth function onto a compact data set. The 
statement is true, however high-order polynomials have a tendency to overfit boundary points and 
have more fluctuations at the input domain's extremes, and thus may not provide good estimates. 
Also, knowing the true order of relationship between the forcing variable and dependent variable 
is somewhat difficult; as the high-order polynomials can result in overfitting of data, where 
the model fits the noise or idiosyncrasies in the data rather than the underlying relationship 
between the variables. This is mainly in the case where the forcing variable is not a good predictor 
of the dependent variable. This implies to the case when including more polynomials in estimation 
increases noise and do not reduce the bias. Thus, we move back to our discussion of Argument 2, 
that the results from the estimates are sensitive to the order of polynomial. Based on the 
simulation results and empirical application this paper supports  the arguments of the paper 
Gelman and Imbens (2019) and suggests to use local linear and quadratic approximations for 
estimates of treatment effect.
